To loop it around, I added a few if statements. |

Surprisingly, it wasn't shifted at all, so I converted the askii numbers back to chars and returned the decrypted message. In my personal opinion, riddle two was even easier than riddle one, and was probably the easiest one of them all. |
| Aug 22 | 3:30 - 4:00 pm | I knew from the get-go that this was binary, but I wasn't sure how many digits represented a character. I saw that there was 4 characters missing at the very end. I initially thought this meants that 4 digits made one character, but I tested this out and it proved to be false. I also tested this out for 1 and two as well, but nothing seemed to pan out. Finally, we used 8 binary digits, converted each to an ascii number, and then to a character. |

Finally, I decided simply to cast each emoji to an integer, and try out random combinations of shifting to figure out which one would finally lead to the correct ascii conversion. |

I initially knew that the initial number was near 10,000, and the ascii letters were number between 65 and around 100. Thus, I tried shifting by 9910 and up, and finally 9919 turned out to be the magic number. |
